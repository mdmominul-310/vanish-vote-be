Folder Structure
The application follows a modular folder structure to separate different concerns:

graphql
Copy
src/
├── app/
│   ├── middleware/       # Middleware for handling requests, responses, and errors
│   ├── module/           # Business logic and module-specific functions
│   ├── routes/           # Express route definitions and controllers
│   └── app.js            # Main application setup (Express configuration)
├── enum/                 # Enum values used across the app (for constants)
├── errors/               # Custom error handling and exceptions
├── helpers/              # Utility functions and helper methods
├── interfaces/           # TypeScript/JS interface definitions (if using TS)
├── utils/                # Generic utility functions and services
└── uploads/              # File upload-related functionality and storage
src/app/middleware: This folder contains middleware used in the application for request processing, logging, authorization, etc.
src/app/module: Contains modules related to the business logic and feature-specific implementations.
src/app/routes: Defines all the routes for the API and connects them with controllers or modules.
src/app/app.js: The entry point for the application where Express app is configured, and middleware is applied.
src/enum: Contains all constants and enums used throughout the app.
src/errors: Houses error handling logic, custom error classes, and centralized error responses.
src/helpers: General helper functions used across different parts of the application.
src/interfaces: Defines interfaces for TypeScript or structure contracts for JavaScript (if applicable).
src/utils: Includes utility methods or services that assist with various functions, such as validation, authentication, etc.
src/uploads: This folder deals with handling file uploads, including storage, validation, and retrieval.
Configuration
Set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory and define necessary configurations such as API keys, database connections, etc.
bash
Copy
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
In the src/app/app.js, you can adjust configurations like port, middleware, and route setup as required.
Running the Application
To start the application in development mode:

bash
Copy
yarn start
This will start the application on the port defined in the .env file (default is usually 3000).

To run the application in production mode (with optimizations):

bash
Copy
yarn build
yarn start:prod
Testing
If the project includes tests, you can run them using Yarn.

bash
Copy
yarn test
